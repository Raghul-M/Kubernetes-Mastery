**Kubernetes** is a container orchestration platform. Containers are ephemeral, meaning they have a short life span and will work until the process is running, crashes (die & revive), or runs out of resource allocation.

- Open source and portable platform
- Automates scaling of workloads
- Groups containers into logical units
- Donated by Google to CNCF
- Written in Go programming language
- Container orchestration tool

**Problems in Docker:**

- **Single host failure**
- **Manual healing** (If it is killed) -> **Auto healing** (Kubernetes)
- **Doesn't scale** -> **Auto scaling** (Kubernetes)
- **Simple platform lacks enterprise-level features**: load balancer, firewall, autoscale, API gateway, healing

**Solutions for the above problems:**

1. **Cluster**: A group of nodes (Master nodes & worker nodes). When one cluster doesn’t get the resource, it puts it in another node.
2. **Replica set/Replication controller**: Auto scaling
3. **Auto healing**: Achieved using API server
4. **Enterprise-level container orchestration platform**: Load balancing, advanced networking, security


**Kubernetes Is Not Always the Solution**

Kubernetes is a powerful container orchestration platform, but it’s not always the best choice for every use case.

Small-scale deployments:
If you have a small number of containers or pods, using Docker Compose or simple container management solutions is often sufficient. These tools are lightweight, easy to set up, and easier to maintain compared to Kubernetes.

Large-scale deployments:
If your application involves many containers, complex networking, scaling requirements, or high availability, Kubernetes becomes more relevant. It provides features like auto-scaling, service discovery, rolling updates, and self-healing, which are critical for production-grade systems.

**Key point:**
Always analyze your use case from all perspectives—complexity, scaling needs, maintenance overhead, team expertise, and cost—before deciding to adopt Kubernetes. Choosing the right tool ensures efficiency and avoids unnecessary complexity.
